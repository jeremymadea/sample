Sample Project
==============

Description
-----------

I often find myself working on self-contained projects involving the 
manipulation and analysis of substantial quatities of data in various 
proprietary formats. Generally I start on these by working with the data by 
hand and creating command line tools for tasks I find myself repeating.  
Usually, as soon as I've written two or three small tools, I start 
refactoring some of the code into modules. Before long, I find the need to 
have different configurations for different systems or data sets, so I add 
support for configuration files. And so on. Before long I can have a full 
suite of command line tools, maybe a GUI or web interface, all sharing custom
modules and configuration options. I prefer to keep these neatly 
self-contained under a single directory whose installation on a new machine
is as simple as cloning a git repository and installing 3rd party
requirements. 

This sample Python project illustrates some project level idioms I like to 
use in these cases. It is intended to be suitable to use as a skeleton for 
new projects. 

Directory Structure
-------------------

I work on Unix/Linux systems so I'm accustomed to the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard (FHS) and I base my project directory structure on it.
